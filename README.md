# Web Crawler

The Web Crawler is a Node.js project that crawls a website and reports on the internal linking profile of the site.

## Requirements

The app requires Node to run. All development and testing was completed using Node `18.16.1`. Other versions may work but have not been tested.

## Running the App

Run the following command in the terminal from the root directory:

```shell
% npm run start <website_url>
```

## Tests

Run tests as follows:

```shell
% npm test
```

## Boot.dev

I created this project while working through the coursework at [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). Boot.dev is a great resource for learning backend development and is worth checking out if you're interested in building similar projects.
